# Lang2Pose

> ✅ Tested on **Ubuntu 22.04** with **NVIDIA RTX 4090**

## Abstract

Lang2Pose is a modular robot control framework that interprets natural language commands for end-effector control and pick-and-place tasks.
Built on ROS 2, the system integrates:

- **Large Language Model (LLM):** Converts natural language into structured robot actions.
- **Perception Module:** Uses FoundationPose for 6D object pose estimation from RGB-D input and segmentation masks.
- **Motion Planning:** Employs Lula IK for simulation in Isaac Sim and MoveIt 2 for real-world execution.

We validate Lang2Pose with both simulated and real robots — a Kinova Gen3 arm and a Robotiq 2F-85 gripper. Simulations leverage high-fidelity physics in Isaac Sim, while real-world experiments use fine-tuned YOLO/YOLO-seg models and Realsense RGB-D data.
Lang2Pose enables intuitive language-driven manipulation and demonstrates robustness even under partial occlusion.

# Insatllation Guide

## 🧰 Isaac Sim Container Environment

Please set up and run Isaac Sim **using NVIDIA’s official container guide**:

👉 [Isaac Sim 4.2 — Container Installation & Run Guide](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/4.2.0/installation/install_container.html)

**Checklist (quick sanity):**
- NVIDIA Driver installed & GPU accessible from Docker
- `nvidia-container-toolkit` configured
- Run with GPU runtime and X11 forwarding (GUI)
- Accept EULA and privacy consent env vars set (as required by the doc)
- Adequate shared memory (`/dev/shm`) and proper volume mounts

> Follow the exact steps and environment variables from the official doc for your OS/driver setup.


## 🤖 Robot USD File Setup

1. Download the robot USD file:
   👉 [Download Robot USD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZIk-99ux3nmo-Qmjeu_wBMI5q0u4Va6E/view?usp=sharing)

2. Place the file at:

`resources/assets/robot.usd`

⚠️ Make sure the file is named exactly `robot.usd`!

## 🔑 API Key Setup

1. Create a `.env` file inside the following directory:

`resources/llmagent/.env`

2. Add your **OpenAI API Key** in the following format (replace with your actual key):

`OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxx...`

3. Make sure the file is named exactly .env and located in the resources/llmagent folder.
This file will be automatically loaded inside the container at runtime.
